1) Copy aion file into folder you would like to run script from.
2) Set path to your server folder in the script.

example edit:
# Path to main Aion folder WITHOUT a trailing slash
RUNPATH="/home/server/server_2.5"

Note: Edit other parameters at yoru won risk to breaking the script. Tested with current trunk. 7/29/11

3) Make the script executable, for all accounts use: chmod 777 aion
 
Usage: (Just type script name for possible parameters.)
[user@aion_server ~]$ ./aion
Usage: ./aion (start|stop|stop-login|stop-chat|stop-game|start-login|start-chat|start-game|status|help)

To start all servers:
./aion start
etc...

It's self explanatory.
Note: This is for linux only.
